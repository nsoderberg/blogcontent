Remote Desktop connection to Ubuntu 16.04 using Unity desktop

Finally, after half a day of tinkering and following this (http://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=9962) guide, I got it to work. For me the trick was, when getting to the "Configure the xrdp settings" section, to do *both* the .xsession configuration and the startwm.sh modification. Then all of a sudden it works! Seems like there are still some wrinkles to clear out, but it works!
