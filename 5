Problems with "Unable to load EntityFramework..." when using ADAL.
Obfuscated exception, not the real reason.
Solution: https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/issues/265
uninstall and install ADAL package.
Some other suggestions, including making a static reference to another package: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14033193/entity-framework-provider-type-could-not-be-loaded/19130718#19130718
Didn't solve the problem for me.
