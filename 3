Consumer networking card in Windows Server 2016

I recently upgraded the motherboard in my home lab server to an Asus Z170 Pro Gaming. I wanted to try out the new Windows Server 2016. Boy was I surprised when I concluded that WS2016 didn't recognize the networking controller on the Asus board, an Intel I219-V. After some googling I wasn't the only one thinking "this sucks, it must be a stupid switch somewhere I can flip to make this work". Found a couple of good sources, amongst others these:

After modifying the correct .inf-file according to the tips in the above articles, I got the drivers to install and the card works like a charm.
